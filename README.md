# ColorSense-ResNet
ColorSense-ResNet fine-tunes a pretrained ResNet-18 model to detect the three most dominant colors in an image. It outputs both color names and their RGB values. Built with PyTorch, it showcases how CNNs can be adapted for simple visual tasks like color detection using transfer learning.
